## PR Review
Your PR will get reviewed soon from the maintainers of the project. If they suggest changes, do all the changes, commit the changes, rebase the branch, squash the commits and push the changes. If everything looks good, your PR will be merged. That's it! Thank you for your contribution! Feel free to suggest any changes to this documentation.

## Note
Contribution can be very small, that does not matter. We even love to receive a typo fix PR. Adding feature or fixing a bug is not the only way to contribute. You can send us a PR for adding documentation, fixing typos or adding tests.
